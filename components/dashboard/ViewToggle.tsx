/**
 * Calendar or list, over the same bookings.
 *
 * Two answers to two different questions. The calendar answers "what does that
 * week look like" — which rooms are free, where a stay could go. The list
 * answers "where is that booking" — the one under a name, the ones cancelled,
 * the ones still without a room. Neither is a worse version of the other, so
 * this is a toggle rather than a default with an escape hatch.
 *
 * The room-type filter travels between them; the month and the cursor do not.
 * A month means a window of nights to one view and a date range to the other,
 * and a cursor from a list is meaningless on a grid — carrying either across
 * would land somebody somewhere they did not ask to be.
