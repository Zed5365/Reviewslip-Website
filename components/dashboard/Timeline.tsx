              This is not tidiness. A bar rendered inside its room's row is a
              different DOM node the moment the drag moves it to another room —
              React takes it out of one parent and builds it in the next — and
              the node the pointer was captured on no longer exists. The drag
              dies halfway, silently, exactly when it crosses a row, which is
              most of what dragging here is for. In one layer the room is a
              `top` and nothing is ever re-parented.
