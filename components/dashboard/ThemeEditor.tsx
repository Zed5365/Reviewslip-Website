 * The theme tab: four colours, and an honest preview of what they become.
 *
 * The preview is drawn from the *derived* palette rather than the four chosen
 * colours, and the derivation is asked for over the wire rather than repeated
 * here. That is the whole design decision in this file. A brand palette is not
 * an interface palette — a pale gold that works in a logo is unreadable as body
 * text — so the review app nudges any colour that cannot carry text until it
 * can. Showing the raw four would promise a page the guest is not going to get,
 * and a second copy of that arithmetic in TypeScript would eventually disagree
 * with the first.
 */
/**
 * An image by its address, for when reading the site did not find one.
 *
 * Which is common, and was previously the end of the road: a logo set as a
 * stylesheet background, a hero behind a slideshow, a site that will not be
 * read at all. The address the reader *did* settle on — even one whose
 * download failed — is offered as the starting point, because "no logo: that
 * file is 4MB" is only actionable if you can see which file it meant.
 *
 * The outcome stays in this box rather than going to the banner at the top of
 * the form. That banner carries the draft's own notes, and a second message
 * up there about a different image reads as being about the same one.

          choice: every colour above is held to a contrast ratio against your

          numbers meaningless. The wash over it is set strong enough that the
